## BigDecimal Operations
I create BigDecimal method in the main file ..... without using package ..
It contains 2 kinds of methods :
     1.** Math.round ** to rounded to the nearest hundredth.
     2. ** MathContext ** to rounds the number to the nearest tenth.

### Car Inventory System
I create Package called com inside this package 2 packages .. 1 package name " carInventorySystem"
This has 3 class _" Sedan, a UtilityVehicle and a Truck. "_ also the main to execute the code .

#### Video Streaming Service
I create Package called com inside this package 2 packages .. 1 package name " videostreamservice"
This has 2 class _" TvSeries and Movie. "_ also the main to execute the code .

##### IntList Interface
I create new project called intlistinterface and inside this package I create two implementations of IntList: _"IntArrayList and IntVector."_

They have the different lengths and different calculates.

**For Example: **
1. IntArray list grows slower.
2. IntVector grows faster.

3. IntArray grows with 1.5 ->            15, 23, 35, 53, 80 ....
4. IntVector grows with a power of 2. -> 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, 320, 640, 1280, 2560...
